# Fail unless every guacd protocol plugin rustguac uses, and guacenc (which
# converts recordings to video for MP4 downloads), was built.
#
# guacd's configure quietly leaves out a protocol whose library is missing,
# even when it is asked for with --with-<protocol>, so a build machine
# without libspice-client-glib-2.0-dev produced a guacd with no SPICE and
# nothing failed: SPICE and Proxmox consoles were missing from every .deb
# from v1.9.0 to v1.11.0. Run this after `make install` in every build path.
#
# guacenc is left out the same way when an ffmpeg library is missing.
#
# Usage: check-guacd-plugins.sh <dir holding libguac-client-*.so>
# (guacenc is looked for in the sibling bin/ directory, as `make install`
# lays them out)
